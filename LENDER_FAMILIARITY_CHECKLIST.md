# Lender Familiarity Checklist - Pre-Filter

**Purpose:** Identify which lenders each broker has actual experience with BEFORE starting knowledge capture
**Format:** Google Form (single submission per broker)
**Duration:** 5-10 minutes per broker
**Send to:** Nwabisa and Dextter separately

---

## Why This Matters

**Problem:** There are 100+ UK mortgage lenders, but each broker has only worked with a subset.

**Solution:** Pre-filter to identify which lenders each broker knows well enough to provide tribal knowledge.

**Impact:**
- If Nwabisa has worked with 55 lenders and Dextter with 70, we avoid 45 + 30 = 75 unnecessary sessions
- Saves ~10 hours of wasted recording time
- Focuses effort on lenders they actually know

---

## Google Form Structure

### Form Settings
- **Response type:** One response per person
- **Collect email addresses:** Yes (to track Nwabisa vs Dextter)
- **Allow response editing:** Yes (in case they remember more lenders later)
- **Progress bar:** Yes

### Section 1: Instructions

**Title:** "Which Lenders Do You Actually Know?"

**Description:**
```
We're building a knowledge base of broker insights for the Base44 mortgage assistant.

To make this efficient, we need to know which lenders YOU have personally worked with and know well.

ONLY check the box if you meet ALL of these criteria for that lender:
✅ Placed at least 3 cases with them in the last 2 years
✅ Have direct experience with their underwriting process
✅ Can speak to their criteria quirks, not just what's on their website

If you've only heard about a lender or placed 1-2 cases, leave it unchecked.

This will take 5-10 minutes. Be honest - it's better to skip lenders you don't know well.
```

### Section 2: Lender Checklist (Checkboxes)

**Question:** "Check ONLY the lenders you have substantial experience with (3+ cases in last 2 years)"

**Type:** Checkboxes (allows multiple selection)

## Analysis After Both Brokers Submit

### Overlap Analysis

Create a simple spreadsheet to compare:

| Lender | Nwabisa | Dextter | Status |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| Barclays | ✅ | ✅ | Both know - capture from both |
| HSBC | ✅ | ❌ | Only Nwabisa - 1 recording |
| Santander | ❌ | ✅ | Only Dextter - 1 recording |
| [etc.] | | | |

### Prioritization Strategy

**Tier 1: Both brokers' top 10** (highest volume lenders)
- Capture from both brokers first
- Compare insights for contradictions

**Tier 2: Only one broker knows** (but high volume for that broker)
- Capture from the broker who knows them

**Tier 3: Both know, but low volume**
- Capture from most experienced broker

**Tier 4: Nice-to-have**
- Only capture if time permits

---

## Time Savings Calculation

### Example Scenario:
- Total UK lenders on list: 100
- Nwabisa knows: 55 lenders
- Dextter knows: 70 lenders
- Overlap: 40 lenders (both know)
- Only Nwabisa: 15 lenders
- Only Dextter: 30 lenders
- Neither: 15 lenders

**Without pre-filter:**
- 100 lenders × 2 brokers × 8 mins = 26.7 hours of recording time

**With pre-filter:**
- 40 lenders × 2 brokers × 8 mins = 10.7 hours
- 15 lenders × 1 broker × 8 mins = 2 hours
- 30 lenders × 1 broker × 8 mins = 4 hours
- **Total: 16.7 hours**

**Time saved: 10 hours (37% reduction)**

**Plus:** 15 lenders neither knows = captured as "no experience" (don't waste time on recordings)

---

## Google Form Link

**[TO BE CREATED]**

Once form is created, add link here and send to:
- ✉️ Nwabisa: [email]
- ✉️ Dextter: [email]

**Deadline:** Complete within 24 hours of receiving link (it's only 5-10 mins)

   - Confirm priority order (top 10 lenders from each)

2. **Send Phase 1 Google Forms** (basic contact details)
   - Only for lenders they checked
   - Organized by priority (top 10 first)

3. **Schedule Phase 2 QA session** (Tara reviews first 3 recordings)
   - After broker completes first 3 Zoom clips
   - Provide feedback on quality/detail level
   - Approve to continue independently

4. **Track progress** (simple spreadsheet)
   - Which lenders completed (Google Form + Zoom clip)
   - Which lenders still pending
   - Which lenders neither broker knows (flag for future)
