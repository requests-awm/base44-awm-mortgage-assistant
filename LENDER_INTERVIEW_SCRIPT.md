# Internal Lender Interview Script
**Purpose:** Capture tribal knowledge for Base44 Mortgage Assistant knowledge base
**Duration:** 10-15 minutes per lender
**Format:** Zoom (video preferred for transcription)
**Deadline:** 1 week

**Interviewer:** Tara (or designated interviewer)
**Interviewees:** Nwabisa and Dextter (conduct separate sessions for each)
**Process:** One interview per lender, per broker (expect repetition, but each broker may have different insights)

---

## Pre-Interview Setup

**Interviewer says to Nwabisa/Dextter:**
- "Which lender are we covering today?"
- "How long have you been working with them?"
- "Roughly how many cases have you placed with them in the last 12 months?"

**Context for Nwabisa/Dextter:**
*"We're building a knowledge base for our mortgage assistant AI. The goal is to capture the stuff that's NOT on their website - the quirks, the unwritten rules, the things you've learned from experience. Think: What would you tell a new broker about this lender? I'm going to ask you the same questions for each lender - it'll be repetitive, but we need your specific insights for each one."*

## Post-Interview Actions

1. **Transcribe** (Zoom auto-transcript or manual)
2. **Save to Notion** under Lenders database (create page per lender)
3. **Tag** with: Lender name, interviewer, date, interviewee
4. **Cross-reference** with existing lender criteria docs
5. **Flag any contradictions** between website info and interview insights
6. **Extract quantitative data** for Base44 decision engine:
   - Max LTV per scenario
   - Income multiples (employed vs self-employed)
   - Max adverse credit (number, value, age)
   - Processing time ranges (MIP, valuation, offer, completion)
   - Fees (arrangement, valuation, proc)
7. **Identify decision tree triggers** *(e.g., "IF self-employed AND <2 years trading THEN exclude Lender X")*
8. **Create lender comparison matrix data** *(For "show me all lenders that accept X" queries)*

## Strategic Note: Why This Matters for Base44

The mortgage assistant needs to **distinguish between lenders** in meaningful ways. Without this tribal knowledge, it can only regurgitate website criteria - which brokers already know.

**High-value data points:**
- **Binary decisions** *(e.g., "Lender X will NEVER accept Y")* → Rules engine
- **Thresholds** *(e.g., "CCJs acceptable if >2 years old and <£500")* → Decision logic
- **Patterns** *(e.g., "This lender declines quietly via endless conditions")* → User experience hints
- **Competitive positioning** *(e.g., "Best for FTB with small deposit")* → Lender recommendation engine
- **Workarounds** *(e.g., "If you call the BDM, they can override X")* → Tactical advice

## Notes for Interviewer (Tara)

- **Don't rush.** If Nwabisa/Dextter starts a good story, let them talk.
- **Probe on vague answers.** If they say "they're OK with adverse," ask for specifics (numbers, thresholds, examples).
- **Capture exact quotes.** Phrases like "they always..." or "never..." are gold.
- **Ask for examples.** Real case numbers (anonymized) add credibility.
- **Note tone.** If they groan or light up mentioning a lender, that's data.
- **Don't worry about repetition.** Nwabisa and Dextter may have different experiences with the same lender - capture both perspectives.
- **Compare notes after.** If Nwabisa says "they're fast" and Dextter says "they're slow," that's worth investigating (different BDMs? Different case types?).
