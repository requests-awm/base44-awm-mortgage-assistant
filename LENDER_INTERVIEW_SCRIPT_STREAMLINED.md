## Tips for Tara (High-Volume Sessions)

### Efficiency Rules
- **No elaboration unless critical** - capture answer, move on
- **War stories section is non-negotiable** - this is where the gold is
- **Vague answers:** Push back with "Give me a number" or "Give me an example"
- **If they ramble:** Cut in with "Got it - moving on to Q[X]"
- **If they forget:** Note "[Broker to email details]" and move on

### Session Flow
- **First session:** 10-12 mins (they'll be slower)
- **Sessions 5+:** 6-8 mins (they know the drill)
- **Back-to-back sessions:** Max 5 lenders per hour with 2-min breaks

### Capture Priorities (in order)
1. **Binary rules** - "They NEVER accept X" or "They ALWAYS require Y"
2. **Numeric thresholds** - "Max 2 CCJs", "<£500", ">3 years old"
3. **War story lessons** - Why cases succeeded or failed
4. **Hidden criteria** - Website doesn't mention, but they decline for it

### Quality Over Speed
- Don't sacrifice war stories (Q26-29) for speed
- If time pressure, skip Q24-25 (recent changes/portal issues)
- Never skip Q19-20 (instant declines) or Q7-13 (criteria thresholds)

## Key Changes from Original

### Removed
- All conversational padding and context-setting
- Probe questions (brokers know what detail to provide after first session)
- Redundant clarifications
- Pre-amble explanations

### Added
- Question numbering (Q1-Q33) for rapid reference
- Structured capture format [brackets] for note-taking
- Time estimates per section for pacing
- Throughput calculations for planning

### Why This Works for 50+ Sessions
- **Repetition builds efficiency** - by session 5, brokers auto-provide the right level of detail
- **Numbered questions** - Tara can say "Q14" instead of re-reading the question
- **Form pre-populates quantitative data** - interview is 100% qualitative insights
- **War stories prioritized** - most valuable section is protected even if time pressured
- **Notion template matches question numbers** - rapid copy-paste of notes
