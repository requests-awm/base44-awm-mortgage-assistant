### Confirmation Message (shown after submission)
```
Thank you! Your responses have been saved.

We'll use this data to focus our interview on the stuff that REALLY matters - the unwritten rules, quirks, and tribal knowledge that separates you from a robot reading their website.

See you at [TIME] on [DATE]!

If you think of any war stories (best/worst cases) with this lender before we meet, jot them down - those are GOLD for our knowledge base.

## Pre-Interview Workflow

1. **Schedule interview** with Nwabisa/Dextter
2. **Send Google Form link** 24 hours before interview
3. **Review responses** before interview starts (5 mins)
4. **Reference responses during interview** to probe deeper on interesting answers

---

## Why This Approach Works

### Time Saved
- **Before:** 15 minutes of interview time capturing basic data
- **After:** 5 minutes of form completion (async) + 10-15 minutes of deep qualitative interview
- **Net gain:** 5-10 minutes more for war stories and nuanced insights

### Better Data Quality
- Brokers can look up contact details without pressure
- Numeric ratings are easier to provide in a form than verbally
- Gives brokers time to think about "best for" and "avoid for" scenarios

### Improved Interview Flow
- Tara can reference form responses: "You said they're a 3/10 for responsiveness - tell me about a time that frustrated you"
- No awkward pauses while brokers search for email addresses
- More natural conversation about experiences vs data entry
