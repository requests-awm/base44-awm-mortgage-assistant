## Reference Files (Tell Tara These Are Available)

- **Full handover:** `TARA_HANDOVER_LENDER_KNOWLEDGE_CAPTURE.md` (1,005 lines - only reference when needed)
- **Lender list:** `LENDER_FAMILIARITY_CHECKLIST.md` (100+ UK lenders)

- **Interview script:** `LENDER_INTERVIEW_SCRIPT_STREAMLINED.md` (Q1-Q33)

## Tips for Guiding Tara

- **Don't assume she knows terminology** (e.g., "Google Form duplication", "Zoom cloud recording")
- **Break down complex steps** (e.g., "Step 1: Click +, Step 2: Select 'Checkboxes'")
- **Offer to generate content** (email templates, form questions, confirmation messages)
- **Check in regularly** ("How's it going? Any questions so far?")
- **Remind her of the big picture** ("Once Priority 1 interviews are done, you'll have the best quality insights captured!")

## Priority Reminders

**Critical points to emphasize:**
1. **Priority 1 lenders = MANDATORY live interviews** (top 10, strong relationships)
2. **Schedule Priority 1 interviews FIRST** (don't schedule all 50-70 upfront)
3. **War stories (Q26-29) are the most valuable** (let brokers elaborate here)
4. **Transcript links are the final deliverable** (not data entry - project lead does that)
