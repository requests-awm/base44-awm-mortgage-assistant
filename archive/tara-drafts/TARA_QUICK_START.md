# Lender Knowledge Capture - Quick Start Guide for Tara

**Read this first** (2 mins), then use the AI assistant to guide you through setup.

## What You're Doing

Capturing broker tribal knowledge about UK mortgage lenders for the Base44 assistant.

**Your job:** Admin coordination - get interviews done, provide transcript links
**Not your job:** Transcription, data entry (project lead handles that)

---

## The Big Picture (3 Phases)

```
PHASE 0: Pre-Filter
└─ Find out which lenders each broker knows (Google Form)
└─ Create priority list (top 10 = Priority 1)

PHASE 1: Contact Details
└─ Brokers fill out BDM contact info (Google Forms)

PHASE 2: Interviews
└─ Capture tribal knowledge (live interviews OR self-recorded Zoom clips)
└─ YOU deliver transcript links to project lead
```

**Your deliverable:** Transcript links for 50-70 lender interviews

## Critical Rules (Don't Skip These)

### Rule 1: Priority 1 Lenders = MANDATORY Live Interviews
- Priority 1 = Top 10 lenders (strong relationships, high volume)
- These MUST be live interviews conducted by you (best quality insights)
- Schedule these FIRST before anything else

### Rule 2: Interview Approaches (For Remaining Lenders)
After Priority 1 is done, you have 3 options for remaining lenders:

**Option A: Self-Recorded** (brokers record themselves)
- Pro: No scheduling needed
- Con: You QA first 3 recordings per broker

**Option B: All Live Interviews** (you conduct them)
- Pro: Best quality, you control depth
- Con: 15-20 hours total time

**Option C: Hybrid** [RECOMMENDED]
- Priority 1 = You conduct live (mandatory)
- Remaining = Brokers self-record
- Saves time, maintains quality where it matters

### Rule 3: Interview Script (Q1-Q33)
- Rapid-fire questions (8-10 mins per lender)
- **War stories (Q26-29) = GOLD** - let brokers elaborate here
- Script available in: `LENDER_INTERVIEW_SCRIPT_STREAMLINED.md`
