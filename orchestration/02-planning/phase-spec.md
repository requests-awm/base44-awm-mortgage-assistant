# Phase 2: Planning - Specification

**Phase ID:** 02
**Phase Name:** Planning
**Status:** In Progress
**Started:** 2026-01-22

---

## Objective

Create detailed execution plan for Phase 1 (FCA Compliance) implementation based on research findings.

**Scope:** Phase 1 only (FCA email approval workflow)
- Core approval state machine
- Minimal audit trail
- UI workflow updates
- Backend validation

**Out of Scope:** Phases 2-5 (deferred pending webhook strategy decision)

## Task

### Task 02-01: Task Breakdown
**Status:** In Progress
**Objective:** Break down Phase 1 implementation into executable tasks with clear specifications

**Approach:**
1. Review synthesized requirements from Phase 1
2. Identify files to modify/create
3. Define task dependencies
4. Create task specifications for Phase 3
5. Estimate complexity for each task

**Output:**
- [execution-plan.md](execution-plan.md) - Overall implementation strategy
- [02-01-task-breakdown/task-spec.md](02-01-task-breakdown/task-spec.md) - Task breakdown specification
- [02-01-task-breakdown/output.md](02-01-task-breakdown/output.md) - Detailed task list with specs

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All Phase 1 implementation tasks identified
- [ ] Dependencies between tasks mapped
- [ ] Task specifications detailed enough for autonomous execution
- [ ] Files to modify/create listed for each task
- [ ] Validation approach defined for each task
